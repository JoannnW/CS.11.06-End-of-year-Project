Open your hands with palms up;
Lift and extend your middle fingers to the sky;
Touch your chest with the raised middle fingers;
Then move your hand outward

Open your left hand, palm up;
Swipe your right hand, palm down, over your left hand;
Make fists with both hands, raising your index fingers toward each other;
Point your index fingers at the person you're talking to

Rub your chest in a circular motion twice;
Extend both index fingers, keep your arms close to your chest,
rotate both arms twice in a circular motion away from your chest and then back towards your chest;
Extend your left arm and open both palms, turn your right palm so it faces the left side and draw a rainbow in the air to your left until all fingers except the thumb lands on the left palm

Do a knocking motion twice;
point to yourself; point forward;
point to the sky


Extend your right hand with a backward peace sign;
touch your raised middle finger to your right cheek;
move your hand away and point your right index finger downward.


Point to yourself;
gesture holding an imaginary box in front of you and bringing it to your chest;
slap your left palm with all fingers except the thumb;
flip your right hand and pat your left palm again.
